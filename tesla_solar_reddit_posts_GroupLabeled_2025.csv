1hqve1s,2025-01-01 04:14:09,1735704849.0,Tesla Powerwall Price setup question/ experience,"Hi Folks!  
I am a bit confused and I am wondering if anyone else had a similar experience or knows a bit more about it.

When I click Tesla Powerwall on their website it tells me that it will cost ruffly 16k for one power wall and about 21k for two. It includes a 4,1k discount because I would purchase two units (all prices are including installation)

I had a company at my house today (I got their information through the Tesla website). He sent me a Estimate of 17k for a single unit and 28k for two units. I do understand the 1k difference for the one unit because of some extra long cable that need to be installed.

After telling him that the website has an almost 7k difference to his price for two units he said that this is based on Teslas ""false advertisement"". He said that they have to purchase the powerwalls in a 6pack and that they don't that that much discount. He was generous enough to offer a $700 discount...

So I am wondering: is he trying to screw me or does Tesla indeed have a weird setup that negatively impacts installer companies?

I honestly aiming for ordering through the website but I also have concerns because the installation at our house is a bit complicated and I am worried that I will run into problems with a random company showing up that just wants to do a quick job. But I also can not justify a 7k price difference....

1hs9ose,2025-01-03 00:49:50,1735865390.0,Thoughts on a Low Offset Solar / Powerwall System,"Hello.  This is my first post in this subreddit.

I am seeking advice on plans for a low offset solar design.  Because of my geographic location, the orientation of my South-facing roof (5 degrees off South) and the size of my roof, I did not expect to squeeze much juice out of the sun.  But even so, the expected offset is less than I had hoped for.

This is the design that I have agreed to.  I haven't signed the loan agreement.  And the site visit is one week from today, so details may change:

**System Size:**

8.2 kW Solar / 20% Offset

**Backup:**

1 x Powerwall3

3 x Powerwall3 Expansion

**Cost:**

$48,000

If I squeeze more panels onto the shady areas of the roof, I could get up to 10.4 kW of panels, with an estimated 3% more offset, but that just doesn't seem worth the cost.

In fact, I'm concerned that the current design doesn't seem worth the cost.  Calculating the breakeven point, including finance charges of 2.99% for 15 years, but not including the TOU (time-of-use) savings that the Powerwall will generate, my breakeven should be in about 72 years ... well beyond the expected life of the system (and well beyond the expected life of the system owner, for that matter).

Here are my considerations:

**Pros:**

1. I live in an area with power outages 2 or 3 times a year.  This would give me electricity during those outages.
2. Beyond the money saved by collecting solar from the roof, I can save by maximizing the Powerwall / TOU.
3. My house is on a well, so when I lose electricity, the well pump stops working and I lose water.  With a backup system, filling the bathtub and all the pots in the kitchen every time a big storm hits, may not be a necessity anymore.
4. I can work from home even in the event of a power outage, with enough juice in the Powerwalls and more trickling in from the solar panels.
5. Not indecent interest rate.
6. I've always wanted solar panels on my roof since I was a kid.

**Cons:**

1. Much higher cost than I expected to pay relative to the expected offset.
2. All the horror stories that I've read in this subreddit.

Despite my reservations, maintaining the ability to use some lights, have running water and internet access during an outage will be a game changer.  But maybe this could be accomplished with Powerwalls alone?  Still, I like the idea of having panels up there to trickle in a little more electricity in the event of an extended outage.

But, please let me know what you think.  Your thoughts, advice, warnings or encouragement will be very much appreciated.

Edit: Over the past year, the household averaged 3145 kWh per month, so about 105 kWh per day.  That includes everything, including EV charging.  So in an outage, we would turn down (or off) the HVAC and not charge the cars. The highest month was 4780 kWh.

Edit: Average electric bill in 2024 was $305 per month.  Heating, cooling, charging EVs, washer, dryer, water heater, range ... everything is electric.

I recently installed a 16.2kW solar system paired with a Tesla Powerwall 3, and it's been working wonderfully—no out-of-pocket bills so far! Last month a total of 2773kw generated from which 863kw used for home, 310kw for Powerwall and exported 1600kw. 

I currently have the Powerwall set to Self-Powered mode, which means it discharges about 80% every night to cover my energy needs.

I understand Tesla states that the battery efficiency will drop to about 70% after 10 years, but I'm curious: will regularly discharging the battery to 80% in Self-Powered mode significantly reduce its lifespan? Or is this usage scenario relatively safe?

For context, my energy provider offers only a single-rate plan (anytime use), so avoiding bills entirely has been a big plus. But I want to ensure I'm not sacrificing long-term performance for short-term savings.

Furthermore, I want to be able to charge the batteries off of grid power as well as from the solar array.  I know Power walls can do this, but I also know that tesla will not enable that feature in some cases.

**We've been off the grid now for 40 hours.** The system has been amazing. We have a 13.8kW system and two gen-2 Powerwalls that have been in service for about 4 years. We've stayed powered without interruption this whole time and the app says we have about 22 hours of reserves at current usage rates.

Winds here gusted to 80MPH and the roof only lost one edge tile that, by the looks of it, had never actually been screwed in. We've been getting about 17kWh a day, which isn't ideal, but it's been enough. We do better on brighter days, but we're in the shadow of the smoke plume.

We've been comforted by lights, a running refrigerator, and charged devices. We indulge in TV at night and air filters that have been running non-stop. I had forgotten to unplug my car (Tesla Model Y), and it was smart enough not to try and charge, which I didn't know it could do. Now that we've gone around and turned off as many of the little energy vampires as we could find, I'm confident we could stay online indefinitely in these conditions. Which is good, SCE has more or less told this area ""don't hold your breath"" when it comes to when we can expect things back.

We've endured two major local fires and a few big storms. Not being afraid of the winds taking the roof, a stray ember lighting us up, or having to cower in the dark, has been such a tremendous relief.

It took me over a month to get on the schedule 

The job was going to cost $2500 

Tesla was only able to remove half of what needed to be removed and had to come back to do the rest. They were at my house for an hour.

After finally getting somewhere on support chat I was sent another invoice for $2800 so they can come back to reinstall the four panels, the inverters and finish removing and reinstalling the module.

System cost with $0 down is $350/month and that’s with 2 powerwall batteries at 7.5% Apr for 180 months

So you are already saving $100 a month. And this is for avg household using 1000KW. 

Now factor in you are off the grid and not paying PGE scum and have battery backup. Oh and the bonus? You’ll get $10k back in tax credits. Double bonus is that in 15 years you will be saving $450 a month. Probably more because we know those crooks only increase rates

What am I missing?","The Reddit post discusses the financial benefits of getting a solar system in the Bay Area, highlighting potential savings of $100 a month, being off the grid, receiving $10k in tax credits, and saving $450 a month in the long run.

Before enabling exports, i could get 7.8kw of solar generation if i could produce enough draw (testing included having the oven and the air con at the same time).  Sure this would only be likely between 10am-3pm, with a temp around 28c with full sun.

However, ive noted since enabling exports, the solar generation maxes out at 5kw, even when i know my solar panels can push more than this.

My understanding, probably wrong, was that solar consumption is >    Usage, Battery, Grid   in that order.

And my understanding is that the inverter is limited to 5kw.

Why could i reach 7.8kw when i had exports disabled ??

Could i just have the normal hierachy with one limitation:   usage(no software limit), battery (no software limit), grid(5kw max)???

its 1pm,  and the sun is right above the home, so all panels are getting to work.   I'd guess for a 9.46kw array,  id get about 80% ???     So 7.5 kw of generation.

I have a Solar Roof with a pair of Powerwall 2s, and a Model 3 with Charge on Solar enabled in the settings. Just like many people here, I'm experiencing a slightly colder than normal weather, with -15C lows and -5C highs. Throughout this time, the Powerwalls, which live in an unheated garage, have been idle almost all the time, with the exception of late afternoons when they would finally wake up and take a bit of energy. And while the Powerwalls are idle, the car wouldn't charge above its unconditional level either. All the energy produced by the roof (because of course it's sunny) that's not needed by the house is being dumped into the grid.

So, I just had a conversation with a Tesla support agent who explained the following:

Powerwall 2 has an internal heater but its main purpose is to keep the battery warm enough to discharge, not to charge. Going from the discharge only internal temperature to the fully functional one takes a long time. Which is why there's a bit of activity in the late afternoon - that's when the batteries finally get warm enough to charge but by then the sun is going down, so the result is negligible.

I’ve installed a 100amp sub panel from the disconnect point to EV wall connector before the system gateway.  The gateway still back feeds power to EV charger from power walls.

1ibid2k,2025-01-27 19:55:46,1738007746.0,Powerwall 3 - Calibration in Progress,"There are several other threads about this, but I didn't find any satisfactory solutions.  Apologies if I missed it.    Background for those not aware - The Powerwall 3 randomly goes into ""Calibration in Progress"" mode for long periods where it doesn't function as it should including dropping to 0% SOC and drawing Grid power when it shouldn't.

The Calibration in Progress can be a nuisance for most, but for those of us in Arizona (perhaps other places as well) whose rate plans contain a demand charge (APS, SRP, TEP) it can be a disaster.  We depend on the Powerwall having 100% availability during On-Peak hours (4-7pm M-F; APS).   Each ""Calibration in Progress"" event, even if only once can easily cost $100-$200+ per month, especially in Summer ($20 / kWh).

I'm on my second in 3 weeks.  Fortunately, I noticed both of them.  The first was a little too late and I had 0% battery, but reduced my usage to only incur an extra $21 charge, could've been much worse.  But if one occurs in the Summer without me noticing, it could easily be $200.

If these calibrations are truly necessary, Tesla needs to:

1. Send notification when they are to take place in advance.
2. Allow scheduling of the calibration events.  For us Weekends work well, even if the calibrations take >24hr.
3. Allow Manual override of Calibration Events.
4. Use programming logic to pick the appropriate schedule based on users rate plans.

Some details:

	•	Location: Cary,NC

	•	Panel Orientation & Tilt: South-facing (general roof inclination of 30 degrees)

	•	Shading Issues: Trees in the back definetely impacting the production due to shades from them.

	•	Inverter Type: Tesla Inverters (4 strings for total of 28 panels)

	•	Weather Conditions: Mostly clear days (winter months cloudy days sometimes)

Even on ideal days, I’m getting around 17 kWh per day (where as my immediate neighbour with similar set and trees in the back getting almost similar KWH), which seems way below what a 12kW system should produce.

	•	Panel Orientation & Tilt: South-facing (general roof inclination of 30 degrees)

	•	Shading Issues: Trees in the back definetely impacting the production due to shades from them.

	•	Inverter Type: Tesla Inverters (4 strings for total of 28 panels)

	•	Weather Conditions: Mostly clear days (winter months cloudy days sometimes)

Even on ideal days, I’m getting around 17 kWh per day (where as my immediate neighbour with similar set and trees in the back getting almost similar KWH), which seems way below what a 12kW system should produce. I’ve checked monitoring apps, and everything seems to be “working,” but the numbers just don’t add up.

Has anyone experienced something similar? What troubleshooting steps should I take? Could this be an issue with wiring, inverter settings, panel defects, or shading I’m not noticing?

Would love to hear from anyone who has dealt with this! Thanks in advance.","The Reddit user recently had a 12kW solar system installed but is experiencing low production levels similar to a 5kW system.

I'm getting goofy house power readings in the tesla app when I charge my Model 3 LR with the WC.

The WC is charging the EV at 11,520watts, however once I start charging, the tesla app sends my house usage reading over to the Wall Connector and does not ever show the true Wall Connector (11Kw) EV charge readings.

My electrician said he put the WC 60a circuit ""outside"" of the tesla solar system 80a circuit to protect the solar/PW system’s 10-year warranty. (and protect the house /solar/PW system). The 60a EV would have been too much for the 80-amp solar/PW system to handle, so he put the WC on its own separate 60a circuit.

Everything is working fine but it’s kind of annoying not getting correct power readings in the tesla app.

I’ve tried everything for weeks, turning on Charge on solar, believe me I’ve tried everything.

I understand it’s because the WC is on a different circuit and basically doesn’t know the tesla solar/PW system even exists.

Can someone please provide a VERY detailed long and complex  explaining on how I can fix it so I can argue those details with my electrician? (I have no clue HOW to fix it, I just know it's a problem)

I would like to charge the EV on solar, to use my excess solar production to charge the EV, but since my WC is on its own circuit outside of the Tesla solar system, i don’t think (?) that’s possible without modification/changes .What are those modifications that need to be done??

There are several other forums that speak of the same issue, however they all seem to be unproductive without any real solutions, so maybe someone else is experiencing this phenomenon as well and starting up another thread can help many.

Meanwhile, the house demand from \~5pm to the event start at 6pm, and from 8pm onwards, was satisfied by the power from the grid, at a mix of Peak and (slightly) Off-Peak prices! How do I set things up so that the PW3 will be used before and after the daily VPP event during these expensive price periods?

design specifications as the original equipment comprising Customer’s PV system. Due to updated

electrical and building codes, it may be necessary to upgrade PV system wiring. Tesla will obtain permits,

acquire materials, and perform all labor necessary to install the equipment described below.

They have come out and replaced the mcu’s and inverters numerous times and everything would work great for a few months then it was back to where we started. At first it was easy to get ahold of them and they would schedule a few weeks out. Now its months and months out. My system hasnt been fuctioning since last summer. I called and put in a ticket and they didnt get back to me in the timeframe they said they would so i had to call back. When i did the phone support person said there was an issue and that the system isnt detecting multiple strings of panels and the inverters probably need to be replaced again (i have already had both replaced multiple times so far). They had me schedule an appointment that was all the way out in jan (again this issue was reported in the summer of 2024). I called and asked is there anything sooner they could do and then i got an email saying my appointment is set for march of 2025 and my jan appointment was canceled. I called back again and said what the heck is goin on and then i got another email saying my appointment is set for the end of april of 2025. Ontop of all this someone reviewed my account and sent me a bill for $5k to replace the mcu’s again because they claimed it was out of warranty. I have the contract that states its under warranty so they canceled my appointment until i paid them 5 grand. They told me to avoid delays i should pay it and then sort the issue out at a later time when the system is repaired.

Just to give some timeline info:

11/16/21 - tesla txted me saying my system was ready to power on for the 1st time.

4/18/22 - tesla messaged me saying my system needs to be repaired. Repairs were done on the 28th of april.

8/9/22 - tesla detected that my system needed repairs again. Repairs were done on sept 12th

9/19/22 - broken again. Repairs set for the 26th of sept.

10/4/22 - broken again repair set for the 19th.

10/24/22 - again the same thing and repair set for the 29th

This seems to be when the system stopped detecting issues on its own and requires me to monitor and report.

11/9/22 - a repair was set to happen

8/3/23 - repair was set to happen

10/3/23 - yet another repair…..

10/13/23 - another repair

10/17/23 - u know the drill

10/24/23 - again….

11/15/23 - broken again

8/15/24 - broken again and was broken for months before that based on the historical data but tesla didnt detect it until they looked at it on the phone. 

Just about all of these repairs have been mcu replacements on every panel and or inverter swaps. They tried doin one or the other a couple times and found that it didnt repair the issue and then had to do the rest of of again. But even so as you can see 5 months after the system got installed it was already broken. These dates are based on the txts tesla sent scheduling repairs and detecting issues. There were some that i had to call in about that arent listed here so theres more repairs than whats listed.

System - 19.38kw system

I get that the amount of sun changes these numbers but im using the info from a section of time when the system was working and when its not and thats a big diff. Thats not just less sun. Thats less functionality.




No one at this company seems to be able to get ahold of anyone else and struggle to get their job done in a way that makes sense. How can it be that i pay tens of thousands of dollars for a system that cant be services or repaired in a reasonable timeframe?? I asked them for a whole new system because somethin is wrong and no one ever follows through. I was told i would get money back for downtime and not once have i been able to get that done. This system will never break even or even come close. My system is pretty large so i should be generating a lot of power but i dont even get enough to cover basic home usage because of the system always being down.

In that time there has not been a single year that the system has worked properly. They have come out and replaced the mcu’s and inverters numerous times and everything would work great for a few months then it was back to where we started. At first it was easy to get ahold of them and they would schedule a few weeks out. Now its months and months out. My system hasnt been fuctioning since last summer. I called and put in a ticket and they didnt get back to me in the timeframe they said they would so i had to call back. When i did the phone support person said there was an issue and that the system isnt detecting multiple strings of panels and the inverters probably need to be replaced again (i have already had both replaced multiple times so far). They had me schedule an appointment that was all the way out in jan (again this issue was reported in the summer of 2024). I called and asked is there anything sooner they could do and then i got an email saying my appointment is set for march of 2025 and my jan appointment was canceled. I called back again and said what the heck is goin on and then i got another email saying my appointment is set for the end of april of 2025. Ontop of all this someone reviewed my account and sent me a bill for $5k to replace the mcu’s again because they claimed it was out of warranty. I have the contract that states its under warranty so they canceled my appointment until i paid them 5 grand. They told me to avoid delays i should pay it and then sort the issue out at a later time when the system is repaired.

Just to give some timeline info:

11/16/21 - tesla txted me saying my system was ready to power on for the 1st time.

4/18/22 - tesla messaged me saying my system needs to be repaired. Repairs were done on the 28th of april.

8/9/22 - tesla detected that my system needed repairs again. Repairs were done on sept 12th

9/19/22 - broken again. Repairs set for the 26th of sept.

10/4/22 - broken again repair set for the 19th.

10/24/22 - again the same thing and repair set for the 29th

This seems to be when the system stopped detecting issues on its own and requires me to monitor and report.

11/9/22 - a repair was set to happen

8/3/23 - repair was set to happen

10/3/23 - yet another repair…..

10/13/23 - another repair

10/17/23 - u know the drill

10/24/23 - again….

11/15/23 - broken again

8/15/24 - broken again and was broken for months before that based on the historical data but tesla didnt detect it until they looked at it on the phone. 

Just about all of these repairs have been mcu replacements on every panel and or inverter swaps. They tried doin one or the other a couple times and found that it didnt repair the issue and then had to do the rest of of again. But even so as you can see 5 months after the system got installed it was already broken. These dates are based on the txts tesla sent scheduling repairs and detecting issues. There were some that i had to call in about that arent listed here so theres more repairs than whats listed.

System info:

System - 19.38kw system
2 inverters

Ours can't.","I wanted to share some interesting feedback I’ve been getting lately from independent solar installers about the new Powerwall 3. Turns out, a lot of smaller shops are hitting a brick wall when it comes to getting any stock. Tesla’s own teams and larger, top-tier partners seem to have a more direct pipeline, but everyone else? Months-long waits or straight-up no availability.

One particularly loyal installer I know has built their whole business around Tesla’s ecosystem. They love the streamlined installs, the user-friendly platform, and the brand recognition that homeowners get excited about. But they’re reaching a point where they might have to ditch Tesla batteries altogether because:

1. **They can’t get their hands on Powerwall 3**, and their customers want it yesterday.
2. **Training on another battery** (like Enphase, etc.) means extra time, potential service headaches, and a loss of that Tesla “brand edge.”
3. **Buying from distributors who do have stock** basically eats up any profit they’d make, and even then, smaller installers are often last on the priority list.

From the homeowner side, this is causing major friction. People specifically request the Powerwall 3, but when they hear it’s not available, they either push back their entire project or look for another installer who magically has a stash. That’s a painful scenario for the little guys who’ve been loyal to Tesla up to now.

So I’m curious, how’s this playing out for folks here? Are you or your installers finding any creative workarounds? Are homeowners more willing to consider alternative batteries these days? If you’ve secured Powerwall 3 units, what kind of lead times are you seeing?

My confusion is that I top up on cheap rate at night Solar does what’s left after sun rise. The only grid feed is at that time from 00:30-03-30. Normally the battery gets to 100% here now around 14:00 as it’s mostly cloudy or raining every day here in the southeast of the UK. So I’m using the battery from 03:30 or when it’s tops up as much as it thinks it needs and I then run on battery all day
. 
The problem is is my in house display that the power company gave me can show say £1:20 for the top up and standing charge included, but by the end of the day that could be £1:40? So why is the grid feeding into the house when the battery is well able to cope with demand all day. The whole idea was I wasn’t going to need the grid during the day at a higher rate. So last month this cost my an extra £12.00. 

Does anyone else have this issue? I’ll be interested if you’ve found a way around it, I’m looking into the. NetZero app to see if that scan help. 
My installer tech guy seems to think it’s a hand shake from the grid to say I’m still here? But surely that would be very minimal or an electronic comms hand shake not a power one ? 
The  only way I can see around this is to go off grid first thing and back on at 00:00.

For any APS customers who have installed solar recently, which of the two available rate plans did you pick, RCP or EPR-2?  For everyone's knowledge, here is how APS describes the plans:

**Resource Comparison Proxy Export Rate (RCP)**

*Bill credits are applied to your account monthly and any remaining credits roll over to the next month. At the end of each year, accounts with a credit balance of $25 or more are mailed a check and balances below $25 roll over to the next year. The credit amount will depend on which purchase rate you were placed on at the time you applied for your solar system.*

**Renewable Energy Net Billing (EPR-2)**

*Bill credits are applied to your account monthly and any remaining credits roll over to the next month. The credit amount will depend on the on-peak and off-peak purchase rates during the summer (May through October) and winter (November through April) seasons.*

I'd like to rely on the wisdom and experience of those who have already picked a plan to decide which way to go. Right now, I'm leaning towards picking RCP.

Also, I'm thinking that using the Powerwalls to export to the grid during peak rate time of use (4PM to 7PM weekdays) would give me the best chance at avoiding the dreaded peak rate demand charge. Any opinions on this?

Installer says option 2 allows for better monitoring but did admit if the PW3 inverter goes out, the whole system goes out. 

In chatting with ChatGPT, this was brought up as a disadvantage as well:

Using the Tesla Powerwall 3’s inverter instead of microinverters can reduce panel optimization because the Powerwall relies on a centralized string inverter approach. The inverter optimizes the entire string of panels as a group, rather than optimizing each panel individually. If one panel is shaded, dirty, or underperforming, the entire string’s performance is affected. This is because the weakest panel determines the overall output. 


That said, the advantages were great, including better grid independence.

# Symptoms:

\- Neurio meter on one inverter will only stay connected for \~30 minutes after restarting the inverter, then the inverter starts throwing the ""Solar RGM Comms"" error and the Neurio starts beeping (very annoying). Neurio has been replaced once and Tesla has ""reinitialized"" the wifi driver multiple times, and the inverter has had multiple firmware updates. I even replaced the antenna with a larger, high-gain one.

\- Power cycling the Neurio has no effect (Pulling the plug and plugging back in while the inverter is running)

\- When this happens, Tesla One also refuses to connect.

\- On the second inverter, there have never been issues. If I power-cycle the Neurio on it, it reconnects immediately (purple light).

\- My installer says that these problems ""are not bad enough"" to replace the full inverter. I don't NEED the Neurio as my state doesn't require the RGM metering, and this isn't the primary inverter anyway. I feel like I was sold a car with a check engine light and the dealer is refusing to fix it.

# Questions

\- Where is the wifi antenna in the system? Is it possible to disconnect it and plug it back in? The standalone inverters without the site controller seem to have a more accessible antenna design.

\- Could the wifi card simply be going to sleep/standby? Any way to change this?

\- What else can I try here?

And just before installation was when Tesla acquired them. There was a gap of about 2 weeks before the project got moving again.  

Long story short on install. I had to make a LOT of calls often to get each step of the project to continue.

Eventually a manager from SolarCity called to apologize and became a direct contact to work out issues. It was still a slow process with minimal communication from Tesla. But the manager was there to find the right people and get answers. Eventually we got it installed and wee up and running.  

Queue almost 7 years later  

Tesla says they need to come out to look at our panels they have an alert....   
Another long story short, they tell me I have to use the app to schedule the appt. But the app never works for this. Eventually after 5 call from Tesla and 3 months. The rep schedules it over the phone for me.

Ok no big deal, Tesla comes out and does the work, removed the panels and replaces a few wires. Puts the panels back on a few days later. Overall a neat process.



That week we find a leak and are not too sure where it is coming from. It may be the peak of the roof might be under the panels.

We figure let us start with Tesla since they were just up there and see what they can do for us.  

They say they will come out and take a look. If it on the roof they will let us know and charge us $300 for the visit. If it is caused by the panels will fix the leak for free and no service charge.  

So they arrive ahead of schedule when no one is home. I get there 15 minutes before the schedule time and they already have 1/2 the panels off the roof.  

I ask why they are taking the panels off the roof, and they say it is required to repair the leak. They will install the panels one they fix the leak.  

Then they all leave a few hours later.

No one contacts me for a week. So i reach out to Tesla support and they say someone will call me.  

Another week goes by, still nothing.

Again someone will call me.

Finally get a call.

""So sorry We are coming by to repair the leak, we were waiting on supplies."" And they schedule a time with me.  

They come by and say ""Actually we do not have enough info on the leak, we need more pictures. This is just a formality so we know what we need to repair it. I will call you back to schedule the repair, this is clearly caused by the panels.""

Another 2 weeks go by. Same deal eventually get a tech to call me.... But wait there is no call. So I reach out to support again.

Actually we found your roof is old and that is why it was leaking. (The roof is brand new, it was installed 1 month before the panels were installed.)

At this point I just want the leak repaired and ask what the process is.

Tesla tells me Just let us know when it is repaired and we will put the panels back on.

In the middle of this Tesla tells me I need to pay the bill for service.  
\- I let them know the panels are still off the roof.  
Tesla says no worries they will still come out and put them back on. I just need to pay the bill first.

Ok so I get someone out to look at the roof and they tell me this is clearly caused by the panels. So i get a 2nd opinions and they also tell me and show me where Tesla's brackets were installed incorrectly. And explain how this is a common issue due to the type of bracket they use.

I had Tesla solar roof installed in 2020. This installation was a night mare from the beginning with a big leaking to my bedroom ceiling which was collapsed creating a big hole onto it and cracks onto living room ceiling! Long story short, Tesla repaired those damages few years later. However, the roof continues leaking until this day! After numerous phone calls and texts and emails to Tesla Energy Resolutions from Nevada to Austin, my roof leak is having their attention! while NY local Tesla operations have kept silent with no response!

Now Tesla Nevada Energy Resolutions wants to use an inexperienced company who is not licensed roofer and has not insured or registered with my town for roofing business and has no customer reviews as it seems that company starts advertising its business on Facebook in December 2024! I disagree with Tesla decision and want to use the local roof licensed contractor with all reliable business requirements and customers' reviews on Google.

I told Tesla I have been sleeping in my bedroom with the hole caused by leak for more than four years and I do not want to keep calling Tesla Energy Resolutions to complain again and again!

My setup consists of:

2 arrays with 4 strings:

* 22 panels facing SW (210°) on an 8/12 pitch roof
* 6 panels facing SE (120°) on a 12/12 pitch roof

I've been monitoring my production using NetZero, and on fully sunny days, the system produces exactly NetZero's estimates until about 11:30 AM. However, after that the production curve doesn’t form a smooth bell curve because it never reaches the estimated peak. Between 11:30 AM and 3:00 PM, production flattens into a jagged horizontal line, and drops off early, after 3:00 PM, instead of continuing to follow NetZero's expected curve.

1jgxqik,2025-03-22 01:56:46,1742608606.0,Does discharging PW everyday shorten its useful life?,"I have a rate plan that charges $0.56/kWh from 4 pm to 9 pm, and $0.28/kWh at other times. I've set my 2 Powerwalls to export energy during this peak period, which typically discharges them to 20% reserve (around 4 pm to 6 pm). After that, they import energy from the grid until the next day when the sun comes up. 

Two questions: 

(1) Would daily Powerwall discharging to the grid reduce its lifespan? Is it better to export energy only from solar so the Powerwall covers house energy use? My house energy use is pretty minimum during current season. 

(2) Keeping the setting at solar export only doesn't seem to be financially smart. Are there any better settings I should consider?

Last weekend I had 12 kW solar installed along with two Powerwall 3s. I do not have permission to export yet, but I will soon. I live in Houston and there's plenty of sun during the summer months.

I'm really struggling to figure out the best settings for operation mode and I would really value your input.

* If I set it to **Self-Powered** and have the car charge mid-day, I can be 100% self-reliant. The powerwalls never dip below 38% at night. But that does mean the powerwalls are charging to 100% and discharging to 38% each day. Lower if there's not a lot of sun. My understanding is that deeper discharges are harder on the battery life. This also means I'm not taking advantage of the vehicle charging credit at night.
* If I set it to **Time-Based Control**, I can specify peak and off-peak hours. But I don't know if it will be smart enough to charge the vehicle from the grid at midnight and not pull anything from the powerwalls.
* A third option is to switch electric providers entirely to one that doesn't provide an EV credit but might provide a better buy-back rate.
* I'm also still a bit confused about **Time-Based Control** vs **Virtual Power Plant**. This seems to put Tesla in charge of when the powerwall is importing vs exporting which also appears to pay better buy-back rates. I'm guessing this is a replacement for Time-Based Control, but I'm not sure I'm understanding this fully.

* If I set it to **Self-Powered** and have the car charge mid-day, I can be 100% self-reliant. The powerwalls never dip below 38% at night. But that does mean the powerwalls are charging to 100% and discharging to 38% each day. Lower if there's not a lot of sun. My understanding is that deeper discharges are harder on the battery life. This also means I'm not taking advantage of the vehicle charging credit at night.
* If I set it to **Time-Based Control**, I can specify peak and off-peak hours. But I don't know if it will be smart enough to charge the vehicle from the grid at midnight and not pull anything from the powerwalls.
* A third option is to switch electric providers entirely to one that doesn't provide an EV credit but might provide a better buy-back rate.
* I'm also still a bit confused about **Time-Based Control** vs **Virtual Power Plant**. This seems to put Tesla in charge of when the powerwall is importing vs exporting which also appears to pay better buy-back rates. I'm guessing this is a replacement for Time-Based Control, but I'm not sure I'm understanding this fully.

I would greatly appreciate any pointers to understanding how this works. I'm very happy to do more reading if there's a helpful article or website you'd prefer to send me to.

I wanted to share an update to my previous post: ""Struggling with Tesla Solar—Undersized Inverter, Malfunctions, and No Response—Looking for Advice.""
https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaSolar/s/Mny536E3v5

After months of back-and-forth, I finally got some real movement—and a resolution—but not without having to escalate things first.

I ended up contacting the BBB and also emailed Tesla Resolutions directly. Not long after that, I was finally contacted by someone from Tesla Resolutions—an agent named Ingrid—and she made a huge difference. She actually listened, looked into my case, and treated me like a real person instead of just another ticket number.

She confirmed what I had suspected all along: my system was supposed to have a second inverter. Tesla acknowledged the issue and told me they would handle everything under warranty.

Since then, they’ve:

Replaced the faulty 7.6 kW inverter

Installed a second 3.8 kW inverter

Replaced two damaged solar panels, which they identified as being faulty due to an installation issue


It took several visits, with the final one happening in March of this year, but everything has now been fixed and my system is working better than ever.

It’s incredibly frustrating that it had to get to this point—months of delays, miscommunication, and feeling ignored—before anything happened. I really wish Tesla had taken my concerns seriously from the beginning. But I am relieved that, in the end, they did the right thing.

If you’re dealing with similar issues, don’t give up. Keep detailed records, keep contacting support, and if you hit a wall, escalate. Reach out to Tesla Resolutions, and if that doesn’t help—file a BBB complaint. Honestly, I thought the BBB was kind of a joke, but they really helped push Tesla to take my case seriously.

I just received our permission to operate yesterday which basically completed the solar  installation process and thought it might be helpful to share the experiences and time line. Also a huge thank you to the community as it helped me think through what to purchase (considering cost, NEM 3.0, energy storage)

Location: Northern California (East bay)  
6.97 kW + 2x PW3s  
$36,077.83

11/26 Placed order for solar  
11/28 Layout completed by Tesla  
Noticed that they put the solar panels on the front of the house, where there is NO sun.  
12/3 MS teams call with the advisor and screenshared with Google Maps and project sunroof the layout of the home and where I want to have the panels.  
12/9 Tesla made adjustments to the layout   
12/10 Confirmed the layout and signed the Solar purchase agreement. Since I ordered before the end of the year, there was a 2k discount on the services. They mentioned through text they would take it off after the site inspection  
12/12 Phone call with advisor to go through the process of the site inspection and any questions I have  
12/20 Notification that site inspection is scheduled for 1/3  
1/3 Site inspection and they went inside the house to the attic and went up the roof  
1/17 Finalized the design and signed the solar purchase agreement with the 2K discount  
1/22 Went with Tesla advisor through whats going to happen next such as submitting permits and any questions I have  
2/4 Permits received and installation can be scheduled for 2/17. Unfortunately, I had to travel for work plus vacation, and rescheduled for 3/7  
2/10 Signed PG&E interconnection through docusign  
3/5 Materials arrive at my home and I cleared the drive way that same morning  
3/7 Tesla send 3 guys to my home, two for installing solar panels and one electrician. Everything was installed within 6 hours including the conduits, power walls and panels.  
3/25 City and Tesla Inspection at my home  
3/29 Backup switch installed by PG&E  
4/2 Completed final payment (Cash)  
4/4 Tesla submitted utility approval (permission to operate)  
4/7 PG&E has approved permission to operate and I turn it on the switch  
4/8 I can that excessive energy is exported to the grid

Overall, my experience has been very positive so far (hopefully things dont break). Most of the delay has been on my end, due to vacation, work travel and in between jobs. Each time I asked for a consult, it was within 2 days and they called on the date and time. Things I didnt know was that payments through credit cards were not supported anymore eventhough during the process they said it was possible. I was pleasantly surprised how fast it all went from the installation to PTO! Hope the above information helps!

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so would you have any ideas on how to fix? I am not sure if user error or software issue. 

Our Tesla Power-wall is set to 95 “self powered” and 5% Backup, as our use case doesn’t allow a direct backup for our property here when the grid goes down. 

My problem is this - In photo 1 you can see we are generating plenty of solar, but instead of it charging the battery which is only at 26%, it’s sending it back to the grid. Any idea why? This is frustrating as we are changing to a time based tariff system and the rates go up at 4pm starting next month. We only had it installed last month, and for the first few weeks would be fully charged by the solar by about midday. Now it is only charged to 45 - 50% by 4PM. 
Ideally we would like it fully charged by 4PM so we can utilise it and what little solar we produce at that hour and avoid the excess “in demand” use charges. 

In image 2 you can see that our house is drawing a fair amount of power, more than our solar can generate, but the power wall isn’t even attempting to supply the home, instead all excess power is provided from the grid. Again, for the first few weeks the power wall would supply as much as it could 5.4 - 5.5KW during the day when our solar generation wasn’t enough to cover the house needs. Now, it just refuses to supply power during most of the day. It will of a nighttime, but not so much during the day. Is there any reason it would not be supplying power in the case of image number 2?

Photos 3,4,5 are the settings we have it set to. Is there something i have done to cause the system to behave the way it is?

I’m reaching out for assistance regarding my recently installed Powerwall 3 system.

In the Tesla app, I’ve noticed some unusual behavior:

* **Grid and Home usage fluctuate with solar generation**, rather than operating independently.
* **Solar generation is always shown as lower than home usage**, which prevents me from:
   * Selling excess electricity back to the grid
   * Charging the Powerwall in Grid-Off mode

Based on my understanding, this behavior may be due to an incorrect wiring setup.

**System background:** Before installing the Powerwall 3, I had solar panels installed using **Enphase combiners and inverters** (AC output). These were connected to the **main service panel** (exterior), which supplies a **subpanel in my garage**.

**According to Powerwall 3 design guidelines:**

* **Solar and the subpanel (home loads)** should be connected to the **Backup Lug** in the **Gateway 3**
* The **Grid** connection should go to the **Supply Lug**

**However**, in the actual installation, the technician connected the wire from the subpanel (which carries both solar and grid power) **directly to the Supply Lug**. (Photo attached.)

While the technician insists that this setup is correct, I believe it does not align with Tesla’s intended system design, and could be the reason behind the unusual power flow behavior.

* Originally, we had a 200-amp main breaker panel outside.
* Tesla installed a new 100-amp breaker panel inside the garage and moved all the house wiring there.
* According to the electrician, using the original 200-amp panel would bypass the solar and Powerwall system and pull directly from the grid, so he installed the EV charger to the new 100-amp panel instead.
* Now the original 200-amp panel outside is essentially unused.
* The EV charger (Tesla Universal Wall Connector, 48 amps) is working fine, and the electrician installed it using a 60-amp breaker on the new 100-amp panel.

* Will Tesla flag this change during their inspection and could it impact the warranty?
* Will the county inspection fail because the EV charger was installed by someone unlicensed?
* What are my options now if this setup becomes a problem?

I’m trying to get some info and opinions on the Solar Roof from Tesla. Had a hailstorm and I need to get a new roof installed on my house. I’ve been contemplating solar for awhile. Now that I’m going to be replacing the roof, it seems like a great time to add the solar array. 

The roof square footage is coming in around 10,000 square feet (the house is around 12,000 square feet living space with the indoor pool). 

My electric usage is between 5500-8000 kWh per month on geothermal. That heats a 20,000 gallon pool at 85-87F year round in Wisconsin cold winters. And does all my heat and AC for the house. 

Tesla’s online roof form spit out needing a 49.5 kW array and 3 Powerwalls. My electric coop utility will only allow a 40 kW system for residential at most I believe and that’s for net metering but no rolling over month to month credits. I need to use up all my banked energy every month or I lose it. If I go with a much smaller 20 kW array, then the net metering allows rollover for 12 months (resets in march every year I believe). 

Estimates to reroof with architectural class 4 impact rated shingles are around $75-85k. 

My insurance is only paying a prorated portion of the 15 year old roof (I believe 55%, I have to cover the other 45%). How does insurance typically calculate costs when I’m upgrading to solar versus architectural shingle I have now (it’s a 50 year shingle and was top of the line when installed 15 years ago). 

On a roof this big, what portion of it would be eligible for the solar tax credit?

Any idea what I’d be looking at for this price wise?

Or do I just put new asphalt shingles in the roof and do a ground mount 40 kW solar array and forget about putting it on the roof?

Any comparisons to CertainTeed’s Solar Shingle or GAF’s solar shingle?

Powerwall:
- does it make sense to get a Powerwall before having solar? What are the benefits of it? Certainly having peace of mind during power outages is great but those are pretty rare in my area.

Solar Roof
- does anyone have any experience with the solar shingles? I hear they’re very tough which is great and in my opinion better than glass that can break, but do they look good on a standard house?
- For reference, we had a different solar company come out and quote us for regular panels and they said we would get around 90% coverage of our electricity needs based on usage, but this was before we got a second fridge and the Tesla car charger put in that we use a couple of times a week (mostly overnight).

Our bill for last month is negative 2.08 which sounds great but I'm a bit paranoid - am I going to get a big ""true up"" bill at some point?
