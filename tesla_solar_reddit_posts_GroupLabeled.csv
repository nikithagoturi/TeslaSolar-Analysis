Also, I figure the people in this community would appreciate the info.

**We've been off the grid now for 40 hours.** The system has been amazing. We have a 13.8kW system and two gen-2 Powerwalls that have been in service for about 4 years. We've stayed powered without interruption this whole time and the app says we have about 22 hours of reserves at current usage rates.

Winds here gusted to 80MPH and the roof only lost one edge tile that, by the looks of it, had never actually been screwed in. We've been getting about 17kWh a day, which isn't ideal, but it's been enough. We do better on brighter days, but we're in the shadow of the smoke plume.

We've been comforted by lights, a running refrigerator, and charged devices. We indulge in TV at night and air filters that have been running non-stop. I had forgotten to unplug my car (Tesla Model Y), and it was smart enough not to try and charge, which I didn't know it could do. Now that we've gone around and turned off as many of the little energy vampires as we could find, I'm confident we could stay online indefinitely in these conditions. Which is good, SCE has more or less told this area ""don't hold your breath"" when it comes to when we can expect things back.

I bought the system when incentives and laws were favorable as a financial move (which only made sense because we already needed a roof) but it has been an enormous comfort. We've endured two major local fires and a few big storms. Not being afraid of the winds taking the roof, a stray ember lighting us up, or having to cower in the dark, has been such a tremendous relief.

I'm fully aware of the peril I'm in, the privilege of having a system like this, and the real losses people are enduring. We've offered shelter and device charging to neighbors, but most have left. I'm only posting to take a mental break and express gratitude for this technology. If you're in this area, stay safe! If you're not in this area, stay away!

2022-10-08 13:56:04,1665237364.0,Hurricane Ian and my Tesla solar and Powerwall experience,"Hurricane Ian - my solar really saved me.  Some of my experiences, and next steps.

I just got internet back yesterday, and power (and water, because we are on a well) came on the day before - so 8 days without power.  

Gas was very difficult to get, with lines lasting for hours, If you were lucky enough for it to still have gas when you got to the pump.  So people with gas generators were on a constant search for more fuel.  Having solar really made life so much better, and gave me time to do the important stuff (secure my home, loved ones homes, and friends homes).  Then help people with cleanup, etc.

I had 3 different solar setups, 1 was a Tesla rooftop system (4.4kwh) with 1 powerwall (smallest system they offer).  Then I had 2 solar ‘generators’ with portable panels.  One was a 1000kwh solar generator that I bought online, and a 100 watt suitcase solar panel.  The other was a 1500kwh one, with four 100 watt foldable solar panels that my father lent me (he got power back right away, because he is on same grid as a school that was used as a shelter).

The Tesla setup was the real lifesaver - i could not afford solar on my house, but I have a detached garage (that I has a 1 bed, 1 bath with kitchenette and family/movie room) that is on a separate electric meter, that I had the Tesla system installed.  It has a mini split A/C system as well.  The powerwall was fully charged prior to losing power, thanks to the automatic ‘storm watch’ system it has in it.  We were able to run lights, the fridge and a freezer from that at all times.  

Our daily charge levels, and routine for the Tesla system:  At night when it came to bedtime, we would be about 65 - 70% battery, we would turn off everything (ac, tv, lights, and only be running a ceiling fan and the fridge/freezer.  By the time the sun was up, we would be about 30-40% charge level.  By 3:00pm it was fully charged again.  We would then use all the power we wanted (AC, microwave, charge batteries for my tools, kids would watch movie, etc).  Once the sun went down, we would turn off AC and tv, and hang out on our patio in the cooler evening air.  We would then turn on the AC, eat dinner while watching the news (with an ota antenna), and then watch a family movie.  After 5 days I had wired up something to run our well pump, so we could wash dishes and take showers… but I accidentally left it hooked up after using it, thinking if we weren’t using water, it wouldn’t be running the pump (I didn’t realize it was running our reverse osmosis system and filling the tank) and drained the powerwall too much, so no movie or AC that evening.  My only complaint on the Tesla system - normally I use an app to see the stats on it, it supposedly has a cell backup, but the hurricane took out the cell towers (or damaged them anyways), I had not printed the instructions on how to connect to the internal gateway… so I drove to get Wi-Fi to screenshot the instructions, and setup an iPad to place close to it, always connected to the gateway (changed the display setting on the iPad so it never went to sleep)… with this we could all monitor the stats in real time.  I wish Tesla would just install a small display on the powerwall though… would have made it much simpler.

On our patio I had my 1000kwh generator setup, with the 100 watt solar running to it… I had luckily bought some extension cables for it, so I had it setup in the yard and it ran 2 fans for us (to keep us cool and to keep the bugs away- because our screens were destroyed).  It was also used to charge our phones.  This setup ran nonstop while we were out there, with only having to move the solar panel a few times a day to align with the sun.

The last 1500kwh system was used to run a fan in our bedroom, and again charge phones, and would charge during the day, and run the fan all night long when moved into the bedroom.  Also used it to cool the dogs (in their kennels) when we left the house.

I wished I had a 200 watt suitcase panel, instead of the 100 - the solar generator can take 200 watts, so even though a 100 watt panel worked for my purpose, it would have been nice to have extra, in the event of cloudy days.

The foldable panels my father gave me were rated at 100 watts each, but they were not near as good as my 100 watt suitcase setup - I’d say they produced about 60 watts - not 100… where my 100 watt produced about 85.  At perfect conditions I even made 105 watts on my suitcase one.

No gas lines, quiet, and allowed us what we needed and more!  

When things get back to normal again, my next project will be a larger watt semi-portable setup with a bigger battery, to hopefully run the well pump as needed.  (Semi portable because I need it to be able to go in the garage to protect from hurricanes, and bring out when it passes).

Having solar really made life so much better, and gave me time to do the important stuff (secure my home, loved ones homes, and friends homes).  Then help people with cleanup, etc.

I had 3 different solar setups, 1 was a Tesla rooftop system (4.4kwh) with 1 powerwall (smallest system they offer).  Then I had 2 solar ‘generators’ with portable panels.  One was a 1000kwh solar generator that I bought online, and a 100 watt suitcase solar panel.  The other was a 1500kwh one, with four 100 watt foldable solar panels that my father lent me (he got power back right away, because he is on same grid as a school that was used as a shelter).

The Tesla setup was the real lifesaver - i could not afford solar on my house, but I have a detached garage (that I has a 1 bed, 1 bath with kitchenette and family/movie room) that is on a separate electric meter, that I had the Tesla system installed.  It has a mini split A/C system as well.  The powerwall was fully charged prior to losing power, thanks to the automatic ‘storm watch’ system it has in it.  We were able to run lights, the fridge and a freezer from that at all times.  

Our daily charge levels, and routine for the Tesla system:  At night when it came to bedtime, we would be about 65 - 70% battery, we would turn off everything (ac, tv, lights, and only be running a ceiling fan and the fridge/freezer.  By the time the sun was up, we would be about 30-40% charge level.  By 3:00pm it was fully charged again.  We would then use all the power we wanted (AC, microwave, charge batteries for my tools, kids would watch movie, etc).  Once the sun went down, we would turn off AC and tv, and hang out on our patio in the cooler evening air.  We would then turn on the AC, eat dinner while watching the news (with an ota antenna), and then watch a family movie.  After 5 days I had wired up something to run our well pump, so we could wash dishes and take showers… but I accidentally left it hooked up after using it, thinking if we weren’t using water, it wouldn’t be running the pump (I didn’t realize it was running our reverse osmosis system and filling the tank) and drained the powerwall too much, so no movie or AC that evening.  My only complaint on the Tesla system - normally I use an app to see the stats on it, it supposedly has a cell backup, but the hurricane took out the cell towers (or damaged them anyways), I had not printed the instructions on how to connect to the internal gateway… so I drove to get Wi-Fi to screenshot the instructions, and setup an iPad to place close to it, always connected to the gateway (changed the display setting on the iPad so it never went to sleep)… with this we could all monitor the stats in real time.  I wish Tesla would just install a small display on the powerwall though… would have made it much simpler.

On our patio I had my 1000kwh generator setup, with the 100 watt solar running to it… I had luckily bought some extension cables for it, so I had it setup in the yard and it ran 2 fans for us (to keep us cool and to keep the bugs away- because our screens were destroyed).  It was also used to charge our phones.  This setup ran nonstop while we were out there, with only having to move the solar panel a few times a day to align with the sun.

The last 1500kwh system was used to run a fan in our bedroom, and again charge phones, and would charge during the day, and run the fan all night long when moved into the bedroom.  Also used it to cool the dogs (in their kennels) when we left the house.

I wished I had a 200 watt suitcase panel, instead of the 100 - the solar generator can take 200 watts, so even though a 100 watt panel worked for my purpose, it would have been nice to have extra, in the event of cloudy days.

The foldable panels my father gave me were rated at 100 watts each, but they were not near as good as my 100 watt suitcase setup - I’d say they produced about 60 watts - not 100… where my 100 watt produced about 85.  At perfect conditions I even made 105 watts on my suitcase one.

No gas lines, quiet, and allowed us what we needed and more!  

When things get back to normal again, my next project will be a larger watt semi-portable setup with a bigger battery, to hopefully run the well pump as needed.  (Semi portable because I need it to be able to go in the garage to protect from hurricanes, and bring out when it passes).

Just thought I’d share the real world use in case anyone was interested!","The Reddit post discusses the user's experience during Hurricane Ian, where they were without power for 8 days but their Tesla solar and Powerwall setup helped them maintain essential power for lights, fridge, and freezer.

2022-09-09 11:46:24,1662723984.0,Tesla Solar Refuses To Fix And Replace A Broken Inverter. Over Three Months Have Gone By.,"I invested $34,000 in a Tesla solar system for my house and it's been 3 months now. I still have not had an inverter replaced. I called Tesla Solar to inquire about when the replacement would be done and they told me that they were waiting on parts. Really??

I got a Tesla solar system installed on my home back in December of 2019. The system came with an inverter, which converts the DC power generated by the solar panels into AC power that can be used by my home. 

In May of 2022, the inverter failed and stopped working. I contacted Tesla Solar and they sent out a technician to take a look at it. The technician said that the inverter needed to be replaced and that Tesla Solar would send me a new one. 

However, three months have gone by and I still have not received a new inverter. I have called and emailed Tesla Solar multiple times, but they have not responded. I am now forced to use traditional methods to generate power for my home, which is costing me more money.

Over Three Months Have Gone By. I invested $34,000 in a Tesla solar system for my house and it's been 3 months now. I still have not had an inverter replaced. I called Tesla Solar to inquire about when the replacement would be done and they told me that they were waiting on parts. Really??

I got a Tesla solar system installed on my home back in December of 2019. The system came with an inverter, which converts the DC power generated by the solar panels into AC power that can be used by my home. 

In May of 2022, the inverter failed and stopped working. I contacted Tesla Solar and they sent out a technician to take a look at it. The technician said that the inverter needed to be replaced and that Tesla Solar would send me a new one. 

However, three months have gone by and I still have not received a new inverter. I have called and emailed Tesla Solar multiple times, but they have not responded. I am now forced to use traditional methods to generate power for my home, which is costing me more money.

Well, here I go again.  Ready to replace my 21 year old roof, got quotes for 25 year asphalt of $17,000.  I submit my inquiry to Tesla, had a call with their certified installer today, and the quote was $164,000 with no Powerwalls, before the tax credit.  About $120,000 after the tax credit.  I have 5 quotes for traditional PV solar, 13.5kW, all around $45,000.  

First - wow.  No wonder they cancelled my $44,000 project if this is what it really costs.

Second - If I get a brand new roof and the same size solar system for $62,000, how can I justify paying nearly double that for a solar glass roof?  Yes, it will look great, but for $60,000 I could make my house look really great in a lot of other ways that would be more obvious to a potential buyer.  

I'm guessing conservatively that my electricity savings would be $150/month.  I'll live here another 15 years, and I don't expect a buyer to pay for the 10 years of savings that they will get.  So that's another $27,000.

[https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/electricity-bills-in-california-will-soon-be-based-on-income-heres-how-it-could-work/](https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/electricity-bills-in-california-will-soon-be-based-on-income-heres-how-it-could-work/)

&#x200B;

Since the charges are based on income and are fixed, it doesn't mater if your net usage is almost zero. You will still pay $100+ bills every month for being connected to the grid. Currently suggested fixed bill for a household income of $180K is $128/month for SDGE customers (who are already paying highest electricity costs in the nation).

It's no secret that most of the solar deployments are done on home where people have higher incomes, since they have the discretionary money to future proof their homes with solar and battery power. But now these households will be penalized.  

It would also disincentivize large households from getting solar since these systems cost tens of thousands for large homes due to higher consumption. It's a lot cheaper to just pay the fixed rate and use as much as one wants, even waste it by constantly running AC, leaving lights on, etc. 

What worries me even more is that this may apply to everyone, including those on NEM2.0 since NEM has to do with the rate payed by utility to the customer for excess solar and mechanics of the accounting for it. However, as long as the household is connected to the grid, it may mean that they still can charge the fixed rate regardless of NEM2.0. 

&#x200B;

I installed solar because my bills were high - hundreds of dollars. My bill now is about \~$15 after getting a solar system.  Under proposed change it would be around $150. It's definitely not the hundreds i used to pay, but it's also not $15. 

They are not only killing the benefits of the solar, but also about to encourage waste and discourage energy conservation.

2022-02-15 02:40:26,1644892826.0,Panels and Powerwalls: The First 365 Days,"This post summarizes my experiences with Tesla panels and Powerwalls over the first 365 days since permission to operate. I have 36 panels of 340W each for a total of 12.24 kW, facing west in Los Angeles, California, plus three Powerwalls 2.

https://preview.redd.it/i1b7c7tntwh81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=12a22b84f6cd8731ae633447a207745d1426303b

Total generation from 2/11/2021 through 2/10/2022 was 17,986 kWh. When Tesla specified the system, they estimated that generation over the first year would be 17,277 kWh. Actual generation exceeded Tesla's estimate by 4.1%.

As is clear from the graph above, generation fluctuated substantially during the year. Average generation by month was as follows:

|Month|Daily generation (kWh)|Percent of Annual Average|
|:-|:-|:-|
|January|26.7|54.1%|
|February|42.6|86.4%|
|March|52.1|105.8%|
|April|61.9|125.6%|
|May|68.8|139.6%|
|June|68.6|139.2%|
|July|66.9|135.7%|
|August|61.2|124.1%|
|September|53.0|107.6%|
|October|40.5|82.3%|
|November|29.9|60.6%|
|December|19.1|38.8%|
|Total|49.3|100.0%|

Unlike with the current Powerwalls 2+, the SolarEdge SE10000H inverter is not integrated into my Powerwalls 2. Its maximum output is rated at 10 kW. When the panels are capable of generating more than 10 kW, their output is clipped. There were 55 days on which generation was clipped at 10.1 kW or 10.2 kW for more than one hour. That's suboptimal, but the reduction in generation appears to have been mild.

On average, 12.6 kWh flowed to the Powerwalls daily and 10.9 kWh flowed out, so that the losses from storage and inversion were 1.7 kWh/day, or 13.2% of inflows. These numbers will vary, of course, with the Backup Reserve. It's currently set at 50% but during the summer I usually allowed the Powerwalls to deplete to 20%.

The system has worked without any problem in this first year. If I would do it again, I would leave our EV charger outside the backup system. We have whole-house backup and my wife's plug-in hybrid frequently drove the Powerwalls to their reserve level during the night. That's something I'll change when my car is traded for an EV.",55,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaSolar/comments/sss9pj/panels_and_powerwalls_the_first_365_days/,"Panels and Powerwalls: The First 365 Days This post summarizes my experiences with Tesla panels and Powerwalls over the first 365 days since permission to operate.

2024-08-07 20:23:19,1723062199.0,Tesla Solar Down Since Install (11 months),"My 39kw Tesla solar system was installed in September of 2023. Before PTO, two of the inverters did not work, but I was told to pay in full (120k) and that once PTO was enabled that would fix the issue. PTO did not fix the issue. I have a 300 foot run from the barn where the panels are installed to the meter on my homes wall (also where the 4 inverters and 3 powerwalls are at).  I tried to work with customer service and after 6 inverters were replaced I was moved to energy resolutions in February of 2024. 

The energy resolutions rep tried a few things, but stopped responding to emails and phone calls for 6 weeks. When we explained this a dozen times to Tesla energy resolutions general customer service they stated only our rep could help even though she wouldn’t respond.  I was eventually able to get a new rep and finally speak to a supervisor in early June after requesting one since September of 2023. They had me get a quote to run a 2nd trench to divide the cable run into two as they couldn’t find anyone to do the work. I provided a quote on July 10th and heard today that that they want to do it themselves and look for new solutions even though they have been “researching it” for 4 months. 

At this point I’m looking for idea/help/attorney to get my system working . Currently 2/4 inverters are up and the other 2 are not wired because the solar system keep damaging the inverters. Tesla seems to not be committed to ever fixing the system as it’s been 11 months with no resolution since install with no compensation or refund. It’s only me emailing and calling 2-3 times a week where I’m told they are working on it. 

I’ve spent probably 200 hours (that’s accurate) working on this without anything to show for other than a 120k paper weight. I haven’t heard of anyone with good results in arbitration. Even if you win it doesn’t mean they will deliver on it. They can just keep stalling as they are a huge company.
